	<p>This book is now in its fifth edition. Each edition has corresponded to a different phase in the way computer networks were used. When the first edition appeared in 1980, networks were an academic curiosity. When the second edition
appeared in 1988, networks were used by universities and large businesses.</p>
<p align="justify"> When
the third edition appeared in 1996, computer networks, especially the Internet, had
become a daily reality       for millions of people. By the fourth

 edition, in 2003, wireless networks and mobile computers had become commonplace for accessing the
Web and the Internet.</p>
<p align="center"> Now, in the fifth edition, networks are about content distribution (especially videos using CDNs and peer-to-peer networks) and mobile
phones are small computers on the Internet</p>
